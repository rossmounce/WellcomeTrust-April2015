### Workshop Purpose
Content mining technologies hold much potential for maximising discovery and reuse of research as well as generating novel scientific discoveries through automatedly searching, indexing and analysing the scientific literature. 

This workshop aims to educate and engage researchers and research-related professionals in the UK who are interested in using these technologies for their work in the biological sciences. In turn this will help to provide demonstrable examples of the benefits of content mining.

Participants will be instructed in use and custom development of tools in the ContentMine pipeline before having the opportunity to apply these skills for their own needs.

### Workshop Objectives
1. Raise awareness of content mining among researchers.
2. Train 20-25 researchers in using the ContentMine pipeline tools.
3. Promote legal and responsible content mining practices.

### Anticipated Workshop Outcomes
1. Research or assessment performed using ContentMine tools by a proportion of workshop participants.
2. Production of new journal scraper definitions. 
3. Continuing collaboration with participants and the ContentMine project.
4. One or more ContentMine trainers recruited from pool of participants, increasing the reach of training for content mining.

### Intended Audience

This one day event is intended for researchers or research-related staff who are not currently heavily involved in text and data mining but have at least some pre-existing computational skills. At minimum we expect familiarity with a command line interface. Experienced developers are also extremely welcome. We expect participants to be researchers working in the fields of life science and biomedicine. All our examples and activities will therefore be geared to biological and biomedical sciences. Open Access content in the Europe PMC repository will be the primary source material for this workshop.

### Documentation

The primary means of communication and taking notes during the workshop will be via this [Etherpad] (http://pads.cottagelabs.com/p/contentmine_bath). 

If you're not familiar with Etherpads, it's easy - you just type! Your writing will show up in a different colour to other people's and you can associate the colour with your name by clicking the person icon in the top right corner of the screen.
